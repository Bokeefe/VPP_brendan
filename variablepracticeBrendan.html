//1.

//Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight.
//It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the user's BMI value. To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram.


var myPounds = prompt("How much do you weight in pounds?");

var feetHeight = prompt("What is your height rounding down to feet?");
feetHeight = parseFloat(feetHeight);

var feetInches = prompt("How many inches above " + feetHeight + " are you?");
feetInches = parseFloat(feetInches);

var mostInches = (feetHeight*12);
var justInches = (feetInches + mostInches);
var myMeters = (justInches * 0.0254);
var myKilos = (myPounds / 2.2046);
var bMi = myKilos / (myMeters * myMeters);

console.log(bMi);






//2.

//The temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) minus 32, times 5/9.
//Write a program which asks the user the temperature in celsius and displays it in Fahrenheit.



var cTemp = prompt("what is the temperature in Celcius?");
cTemp = parseFloat(cTemp);


var oneLine = ((cTemp * 9)/5)+32;
console.log(oneLine);


//Create a program which prompts the user to enter five test scores. Then, output the average of the five test scores.

var firstNum = prompt("Please enter your first test score.");
firstNum = parseFloat(firstNum);
var secondNum = prompt("Please enter your second test score.");
secondNum = parseFloat(secondNum);
var thirdNum = prompt("Please enter your third test score.");
thirdNum = parseFloat(thirdNum);
var fourthNum = prompt("Please enter your fouth test score.");
fourthNum = parseFloat(fourthNum);
var fifthNum = prompt("Please enter your fifth test score.");
fifthNum = parseFloat(fifthNum);

scoreAvg = ((firstNum + secondNum + thirdNum + fourthNum +fifthNum)/5);
console.log(scoreAvg);
